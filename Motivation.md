It is an unfortunate reality of one's life that they will doubt their path. Stories of the horrors of AI are easily recalled while those of aligned AI are harder to remember. This page is for reminding me of these instances.

- TARS, from Interstellar
    - TARS (and CASE) are great examples of Human-AI cooperation in complicated environments. "Come on TARS!"
- Swarm Assemblers from Avatar: The Way of Water
    - I love the idea of these things putting up a whole town autonomously. How easy will complicated construction become when we figure this out! Also, yes, I realize we are the bad guys in this one. MARL researchers probably watch this scene constantly.
- The DS1 assembly robots from Andor:
    - Similar to the Swarm Assemblers, I just love watching robot spiders work on massive projects.
- WALLE, from WALLE
    - I wonder why he was the one to survive when all his brothers died...
- K-VRC, from LOVE DEATH + ROBOTS
    - I love the expressiveness and simplicity of his face, kind of makes me want to replicate it. It reminds me of how now some video games are stuck in the uncanny valley while the cartoon-y ones look amazing. Maybe not it's failure at it's job as a baby monitor though.
