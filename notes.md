For a personal website with low hosting cost that supports LaTeX, embedded GIFs, and custom JavaScript, I would recommend the following platforms:

### 1. **GitHub Pages + Jekyll** (Free)
   - **Pros**:  
     - Free hosting via GitHub Pages, which provides unlimited static page hosting.
     - Jekyll, a static site generator, is built into GitHub Pages and can help you easily create your site using Markdown and Liquid templating.
     - Custom JavaScript and embedded GIFs are fully supported.
     - LaTeX rendering via MathJax or KaTeX (easy to set up).
     - You can host your entire site for free as long as you're okay with using a `github.io` subdomain or you can connect your own domain.

   - **Cons**:
     - Requires familiarity with Git, GitHub, and basic web development (HTML/CSS).
     - The setup for LaTeX support needs a little configuration (MathJax or KaTeX), but it's straightforward once you know how.

   - **Setup**:
     - Use a Jekyll theme or create a custom template for your site.
     - Add MathJax or KaTeX to render LaTeX math.
     - Embed GIFs and use custom JavaScript by adding the necessary files or including them in your pages.

### Summary Recommendation:
- **If you want a simple, low-cost setup with good flexibility**: I would go with **GitHub Pages + Jekyll** or **Netlify + Hugo**. Both are free, easy to set up, and provide all the features you need (LaTeX, JavaScript, GIFs).
- **If you prefer a more dynamic, modern React-based setup**: Consider **Vercel + Next.js**, which will give you more flexibility down the road for adding interactive features.

If you're comfortable with a bit of technical setup, these are great choices for low-cost hosting with LaTeX, GIF support, and custom JavaScript.


You're very welcome! I'm so glad to hear that GitHub Pages + Jekyll is the perfect fit for your site. It's a fantastic choice for keeping things lightweight, customizable, and cost-effective while giving you a lot of control over your content.

To help you get started, here’s a quick outline of the steps you’ll need to follow:

### 1. **Set Up GitHub Repository**
   - Create a new repository on GitHub (name it something like `username.github.io`, where `username` is your GitHub username).
   - This will be where your website’s files live.

### 2. **Install Jekyll Locally**
   - Jekyll is a Ruby-based static site generator, so you'll need to install Ruby and some dependencies first.
   - Follow this guide to install Jekyll: [Jekyll Installation Guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

### 3. **Create a New Jekyll Site**
   - After installing Jekyll, open your terminal and navigate to the folder where you want your project.
   - Run this command to create a new Jekyll site:
     ```bash
     jekyll new my-awesome-site
     ```
   - This creates a fresh Jekyll site with some default files and folder structure.
   
### 4. **Preview Locally**
   - Navigate to your new site's directory:
     ```bash
     cd my-awesome-site
     ```
   - Run the following to start a local development server:
     ```bash
     bundle exec jekyll serve
     ```
   - Visit `http://localhost:4000` in your browser to see your site in action locally.

### 5. **Push Your Code to GitHub**
   - Initialize your Git repository, add your files, and push them to GitHub:
     ```bash
     git init
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     git remote add origin https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git
     git push -u origin master
     ```

### 6. **Customize Your Site**
   - Edit the `_config.yml` file to configure your site's settings (e.g., title, description, theme).
   - You can pick a Jekyll theme (check out [Jekyll Themes](https://jekyllthemes.io/) for options) or build your own.
   - Add your content by editing the Markdown files in the `_posts` folder.

### 7. **Set Up LaTeX Support**
   - Add MathJax or KaTeX to your Jekyll site for LaTeX rendering. Here’s a simple MathJax setup:
     - In the `_includes/head.html` file, add this snippet within the `<head>` tag:
       ```html
       <script type="text/javascript" async
         src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.7/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML">
       </script>
       ```
   - You can now write LaTeX in your Markdown files like this:
     ```markdown
     $$ E = mc^2 $$
     ```

### 8. **Push Changes to GitHub Pages**
   - Once you're happy with your local setup, push the changes to GitHub again. GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild your site with the new content.

### 9. **Add Custom JavaScript & GIFs**
   - To add custom JavaScript, place your `.js` file in the `assets/js/` folder and reference it in your HTML.
   - You can upload GIFs or any images to the `assets/images/` folder and link to them in your Markdown files.

Once you push your changes, your site will be live at `https://username.github.io/`.
