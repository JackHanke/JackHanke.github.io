I occasionally enjoy generating trivia questions for things I am interested in, especially the original six Star Wars movies.

## Star Wars Trivia

- What character appears on screen for only the first and last movie (The Phantom Menace and Return of the Jedi)?
    - Bib Fortuna

- List all characters who's name is spoken in a movie, and yet only appear in one scene (where a scene means shots of a single location with no cuts to another location).
    - [Greedo](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Greedo)
    - [Dexter Jestter](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dexter_Jettster)
    - [Cord√©](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cord%C3%A9)
    - [General Crix Madine](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Crix_Madine)
    - [Queen Jamilia](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jamillia)
    - [Jedi Padawan Liam](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Liam)
    - TODO

- Similarly, what character is named the most but seen the least? (Which character has the highest ratio between instances named and distinct scenes appeared.)
    - TODO

## Music Trivia

- What artist appears on the covers of two of the most popular albums of all time, but is much better known for another profession?
    - John Travolta, appearing on both [Saturday Night Fever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Fever_(soundtrack)) and [Grease: The Original Soundtrack from the Motion Picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grease_(1978_soundtrack)).
