Hello! My name is Jack Hanke. I usually write about machine learning and mathematics projects. I use these projects to learn and grow üå±

My posts will vary in the amount of work they achieve. The number of stars (‚≠ê) at the beginning of the post indicate scope, up to a possible of 5.  

Another goal of my blog is to motivate and inspire. My posts will often include a section with further questions or other directions for you to explore.

Thank you for reading!

All opinions my own.
