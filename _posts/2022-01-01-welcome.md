My name is Jack Hanke, I usually write about machine learning and mathematics. My posts will vary in the amount of work they achieve, so I include a "scope" indicator at the top. The number of stars (‚≠ê) at the beginning of the post indicate scope, up to a possible of 5.  

Another goal of my blog is to inspire. My posts will often include a section with further questions for you the reader to take on! 

Thank you for reading!
