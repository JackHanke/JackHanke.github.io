Welcome to my website!

I usually write about machine learning and mathematics projects. The blog post is the sweet spot for rigor, entertainment, and time-to-make. The posts will naturally vary in the amount of work and scope they achieve. I sometimes work on small "cute" math problems, and other times I spend months studying and programming a new algorithm.  

Because of this, I include a "scope" indicator at the top of a post. This scope rating is indicated with the number of stars (‚≠ê) at the beginning of the post, up to a possible of 5. 

Another goal of my blog is to inspire. My posts will often include a section with further questions for you the reader to take on! 

Thank you for reading!
