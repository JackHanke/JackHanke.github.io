Welcome to my website!

I usually write about machine learning and mathematics. My intention with these blogposts is to tell the story of my projects as much as it is to show the results. I am of the opinion that educational outreach in these topics often fails to convey the story the work is so often accompanied by. 

I have tried other mediums to summarize my projects, but I've found that a formal writeup often loses the story, while a YouTube video often loses the rigor. I think the blogpost is a perfect mix of these two mediums. 

The posts will naturally vary in the amount of work and scope they achieve. I sometimes work on small "cute" math problems, and other times I spend months studying and programming a new algorithm. I am looking for a way to incorporate a "level-of-scope" and "level-of-difficult" indicator for a specific post, to better inform a potential reader of what they are getting in to.

Another goal of my blog is to inspire. My posts will often include a section with further questions for you the reader to take on! Thank you for reading!
