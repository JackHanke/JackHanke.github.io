## Educators

---

- David MacKay's [Everything is Connected](https://itila.blogspot.com/)

I had the pleasure of watching [David MacKay's Information Theory Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCiZc0n6COY&list=PLruBu5BI5n4aFpG32iMbdWoRVAA-Vcso6) hosted on [Jakob Foerster's](https://www.jakobfoerster.com/) YouTube channel. I was sad to learn of his passing, and enjoyed reading through his musings after I completed the lecture series. 

## Researchers and Practitioners

---

- Alex Irpan's [Sorta Insightful](https://www.alexirpan.com/)

The blog I have modeled my own after, and not just the styling. I was originally brought to Alex's blog because of his famous [Deep Reinforcement Learning Doesn't Work Yet](https://www.alexirpan.com/2018/02/14/rl-hard.html) post, and stayed for his experience and wit.

- [Julian Schrittwieser's Blog](https://www.julian.ac/index.html)

Julian is the kind of smart that freaks me out. He was one of the technical leads on AlphaGo, which was project that lead me to study machine learning.

- [Ethan Smith's Blog](https://www.ethansmith2000.com/)

Ethan's blog is another inspiration for my own, especially including a section for artwork. I especially like his "SoftMax Attention is a Fluke" post.

- [Neel Nanda's Blog](https://www.neelnanda.io/about)

Both Neel and Rob Miles are great natural educators, and Neel's blog is great for reading what the cutting edge in AI safety is up to.

- [near.blog](https://near.blog/)

I first read [Personality Basins](https://near.blog/personality-basins/), then stayed for the other posts.

## Collaborators

- [Dan Plotkin's Site](https://www.danielplotkin.com/)

Dan and I have worked on LLMs, RL, and SL projects together, and his individual projects are well worth the read.
