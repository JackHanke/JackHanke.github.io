Other blogs I often read:

- Alex Irpan's [Sorta Insightful](https://www.alexirpan.com/)

The blog I have modelled my own after, and not just the styling. 

A blog I see 
- David MacKay's [Everything is Connected](https://itila.blogspot.com/)

I had the pleasure of watching [David MacKay's Information Theory Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCiZc0n6COY&list=PLruBu5BI5n4aFpG32iMbdWoRVAA-Vcso6) hosted on [Jakob Foerster's](https://www.jakobfoerster.com/) YouTube channel. I was sad to learn of his passing, and enjoyed reading through his musings after I completed the lecture series. 

- Julian Schrittwieser's [Furidamu](https://www.furidamu.org/)

Julian's work is the reason I study machine learning.
