# Personal Website for Jack Hanke

Source of my [personal website] (https://jackhanke.github.io/).

The point of this website is to host my ml and math work, as well as any personal blogs I may want to write up. The technical posts will be in story format, being more formal than a YouTube video but less so than a paper or writeup. I want to include the story aspect of the work. 

## Development

`bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload`

## TODOs
